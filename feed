				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;">While we might be world famous for our amazingly artistic wedding cakes and sculpted cakes, what truly makes our bakery special receives much less publicity: effort.  It&#8217;s our <em>secret ingredient.</em>  We don&#8217;t have to grind each cup of coffee individually, or hand squeeze our orange juice a cup at a time, or insist that everything we bake and sell is made on-site from raw ingredients.  If we could bring ourselves to use mixes, or frozen doughs, or a buttercream recipe that doesn&#8217;t take 5x longer to make, our lives would be much easier – but that&#8217;s not who we are.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">We are here because some things are more important than profit margins, convenience or cheap calories.  If we don&#8217;t make life-sized cakes of Star Wars characters, few others can, and if we don&#8217;t serve the type of skill and labor intensive foods that we serve, no one else will.  Every day customers tell us: &#8220;I don&#8217;t like cake, but this is good!&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t like fondant, but this is amazing!&#8221; or &#8220;This is the best orange juice I&#8217;ve ever had!&#8221;  But the truth is that there is no magic here.  You just saw us squeeze the oranges directly into your cup.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s different.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s better.  To our surprise, making real food by hand from raw ingredients has proven more novel than even our most whimsical wedding cake.  We truly hope that you enjoy our food as much as we have loved making it.</p>

<h1>Bake Shop Goodies</h1>
<div class="small-12 medium-5 columns gallery-padding">
<p>Every single day, before dawn even thinks about cracking, our bakers are cracking eggs, mixing, and baking away so you can have a completely new selection of delicious goodies.  Where most bakeries are content to simply &#8220;bake&#8221; on site (AKA freezer-to-oven bakeries), we do all of our baking from raw ingredients in small batches.  For this reason, much of our selection is completely different every single day based on what&#8217;s in season.  Here&#8217;s some of the fun stuff that we do:</p>
<h3>Hand-made Pop Tarts!</h3>
<p>These are like mini hand pies made with a flaky pie dough, made fresh everyday, and filled with whatever&#8217;s in season.  Flavors range from triple berry jam in the summer, to pumpkin pie filling in the fall and chocolate peppermint ganache in the winter.  These sell out fast so get here early.</p>
<h3>Cupcakes</h3>
<p>We always have our three basic gourmet flavors of cupcakes, which are Yellow, Red Velvet and Chocolate, available in our case everyday.  Beyond that our bakers bake off extra batter from custom cakes which are new and different every week.  Some weeks we might have pina colada cupcakes and another week we might have strawberries and champagne cupcakes.  Our decorators are given the creative freedom to mix and match cupcakes and buttercream as they see fit.  Stop by to see what we have today!<br />
-Cupcakes are also available with <a href="http://oakleafcakes.com/cupcakes">customized decorations </a>if you order in advance.</p>
<h3>Muffins</h3>
<p>Muffins, more hearty than cupcakes, also change with the seasons.  In late spring we love making rhubarb muffins with rhubarb from the farmers market and in the fall we have a pumpkin streusel muffin that is to die for.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>We always make our own cookie dough and our cookies are baked off fresh every morning.  Our confetti sugar cookies are always popular with the colors changing with each passing holiday.  Some of our other customer favorites are chocolate chunk cookies and vegan peanut butter cookies.</p>
<h3>Scones</h3>
<p>Scones are baked in small batches to ensure they stay fresh all day.  A couple staff favorites are the chocolate chip scones and the cranberry orange scones.  Sometimes a little (a lot) self control is necessary to work here.</p>
<h3>Cheesecake</h3>
<p>Our bakers have perfected the art of baking cheesecake.  Our cheesecakes are made from scratch with a shortbread cookie crust, bake up extra tall and are decorated with Italian meringue buttercream.  We always have a few flavors available in our display case everyday.  Our cheesecakes come in 3 sizes.  9&#8243; (feeds 16), 7&#8243; (feeds 9), and a mini cheesecake that you could share with one other person but only if you wanted to.   Like the rest of our baked goods cheesecake flavors change with the seasons.  Our summer favorite is coconut lime cheesecake while our cappuccino cheesecake is a year round delight.</p>
<h3>Trifle Cups</h3>
<p>Decadence in a cup.  These cute little cups are brimming over with our very own house-made mouses, creams, and fillings.  From our refreshing Lemon Dream trifle, to our rich and creamy Brownie Bliss, to a million other amazing combos, these creamy trifle cups are hands down our new favorite thing.</p>
<h3>Brownies</h3>
<p>Our brownies are probably the only thing we make that is always the same.  If you&#8217;ve got a craving for some serious chocolate these brownies are for you.  No messing around.  Just a seriously chocolatey, fudgey brownie. (without nuts!)  Sometimes we spice things up and make Aztec chocolate brownies.</p>
<h3>Sweet Breads</h3>
<p>After we made it once customers came back looking for it and esentially demanded we always have our banana chocolate chip bread available.  In addition to banana bread we usually have one other bread choosing from coffee cake bread, zucchini bread, and even cranberry orange walnut bread.  Bread is available by the slice if you&#8217;re dining in or you can buy the whole loaf to take home to share (or not).</p>
<h3>Hand-made Marshmallows</h3>
<p>These are really fun, and really messy, to make.  Our most popular flavor is the toasted coconut marshmallow.  The contrasting textures of the crispy coconut and silky smooth mallow is amazing.  In the winter months try one of our vanilla marshmallows in your hot chocolate.</p>
<h3>Macarons</h3>
<p>We also make french macarons.  The are made using almond flour so they are gluten free.  They are available in several flavors from plain vanilla, chocolate fudge to lemon curd. These are a special occasion item so it would be best to order these in advance.</p>
<h3>Whoopie Pies</h3>
<p>Whoopies are for people who really enjoy their frosting to cake ratio to highly favor the frosting.  Most whoopies are filled with a marshmallow fluff frosting, while sometimes we fill the chocolate whoopies with peanut butter frosting.  The customer favorite is probably a tie between the oatmeal cream pies and red velvet whoopies.</p>
<h3>Vegan Options</h3>
<p>Whether you have a egg or dairy allergy or eating vegan is a lifestyle choice we always have several vegan baked goods everyday.  Options include at least one cookie, one muffin and one-two cupcake flavors.  We occasionally make treats that are just dairy free, just ask us when you&#8217;re in next time.</p>
<h3>Gluten Free Options</h3>
<p>We are not a gluten free bakery so if you have a serious allergy please take caution when ordering.  However, we do offer two items that are gluten free. Our marshmallows and our macaroons are both gluten free.</p>

<h1>Squeezed to order Specialty Drinks <small>(and not squeezed, but still really awesome)</small> Hot Chocolate</h1>
<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns gallery-padding">
<h3>Orange Juice</h3>
<p>Do you know what&#8217;s in your juice?  Our customers do.  Delicious Florida Red Valencia oranges.  That&#8217;s it.  And we think you&#8217;ll agree that it&#8217;s the best juice you&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p>If you buy orange juice from a store, it&#8217;s often undergone various types of treatment – most of it to the point where it can barely be described as juice anymore.  Even if you get the most premium, 100% natural, guaranteed to be the real-deal juice, the extraction methods used by large commercial juicers often compromise the juice by inevitably mixing it with bitter outer rind of the orange.</p>
<p>Our squeezing process avoids this.  Using our high-tech <a href="http://www.zummoinc.com/products/food-service/z1c">ZUMMO</a> juicer, our oranges are sliced, squeezed and extracted while you watch.  The process is delicate enough that the juice never comes into contact with the rind at any time in the juicing process, meaning that your juice couldn&#8217;t be purer.  It&#8217;s so good, in fact, that some of our most loyal customers can even distinguish between the different Florida farms where the oranges were grown.</p>
<h3>Lemonade</h3>
<p>As with our orange juice, our lemonade is as pure as possible, using only lemons, sugar, and H20.  The lemons are sliced and squeezed by hand while you watch.  If you want to spice things up, we also offer strawberry and raspberry flavors for ultimate refreshing goodness!</p>
<h3>Hot Chocolate</h3>
<p>Now this is something special.  We make our own custom hot chocolate mixes from raw ingredients in house.  We have two different varieties, a warm and comforting traditional Hot Cocoa, as well as a spicy Aztec Hot Chocolate that has cinnamon, dark cocoa and cayenne pepper for that little extra kick.</p>
<p>But as cool as that is, it&#8217;s nothing compared to the real star of the show: HAND MADE MARSHMALLOWS!  If you&#8217;ve never had a real, hand made marshmallow your life is incomplete.  This is one heavenly dessert that Jet Puff just couldn&#8217;t replicate.  We chunk them into huge squares and put them on the side of your cup like a wedge of lemon.  Bon-Freakin-Appetit!</p>
<h3>Fruity Drink Combos</h3>
<p>What do you get when you take our amazing orange juice, lemonade, and iced teas and mix them into a bunch of different fun and adventurous combinations?  Awesomesauce.  Oh, and these really cool drink combos:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arnold</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Palmer:</span></strong>  This bad boy is a 50-50 mix of our cold brewed English Breakfast iced tea and our hand squeezed lemonade.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Green Tea-Ade:</strong></span> Like the Arney, this is a 50-50 mix of lemonade and tea, but with our Golden Green iced tea this time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sunrise Squeeze:</strong></span> This drink is as good looking as it is delicious.  From bottom to top, it is strawberry, OJ, and lemonade in a beautiful ombre explosion of flavor.</p>

<p>When it comes to tea, nothing is more critical than having fresh high-quality ingredients, paired with a really solid brew method.  To make sure that our tea is top notch, we brew only <a href="http://memteaimports.com" target="_blank"><strong>MEM loose leaf teas.  MEM Tea Imports</strong></a> is another exceptional local business that is almost as famous for the quality of their teas as we are for cake!</p>
<p>To make sure that your tea is brewed to perfection, we hot brew each of our teas using our aeropress brewing machines.  This allows us to custom tailor the perfect brew cycle for each strand of tea we serve.</p>
</div>
<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns gallery-padding end">
<p>For iced tea, we employ a traditional cold-brew methodology to ensure that the tea isn&#8217;t shocked by radical temperature changes usually associated with brew methods used at larger corporate coffee houses.</p>
<p>Lastly, our Spicy Chai Tea Lattes are made with a 50-50 blend of tea and milk using a concentrated Chai tea that we brew from loose leaves on-site.  Our Chai tea lattes are available either iced or steamed, and have a flavor that is beyond description.</p>

<h1>Boston&#8217;s ONLY ground and brewed to order coffee and espresso!</h1>
<div class="row">
<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns gallery-padding">
<p>Not satisfied with making seven foot tall movie characters out of cake, we decided to try our hand at coffee. When we opened our first storefront in Winthrop the space was not set up for serving coffee, but with our move to Boston in the fall of 2013 we thought we&#8217;d give it a try. Naturally we way out-did ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns gallery-padding end">
<p>Sure we could have opted for a middle of the road coffee set up, with fancy machines that did most of the work for us, but where&#8217;s the fun in that? No, instead we opted to grind every single cup of coffee and espresso by hand to order. While many high end espresso shops do grind to order currently, NO ONE grinds their coffees to order. To see how we do it, check out the illustration below!</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>From beans to cup in under 2 minutes:</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns gallery-padding">
<h3>•• Step 1 ••</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1264 size-large colorbox-1207" src="http://oakleafcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/comic1.svg" alt="comic1" width="251" height="251" />
<p><strong>Choose your beans.</strong> Be sure to make direct eye contact with your beans. As they are being ground just for you, it is the only honorable course of action.</p>
</div>
<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns gallery-padding end">
<h3>•• Step 2 ••</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1265 size-large colorbox-1207" src="http://oakleafcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/comic2.svg" alt="comic2" width="172" height="172" />
<p><strong>The beans you have just selected are ground fresh while you wait.</strong> Because of our unique aeropress brew method we are able to grind the beans incredibly coarse, which means that you get all the flavor of the bean, without unlocking so many of the nasty, bitter bits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns gallery-padding">
<h3>•• Step 3 ••</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1266 size-large colorbox-1207" src="http://oakleafcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/comic3.svg" alt="comic3" width="133" height="133" />
<p>Your coffee is individually brewed, just for you in our Trifecta aeropress machines. In traditional drip brewers, water channels through the grounds. As it channels, it erodes paths for itself causing some areas to over-extract, while other areas are not extracted at all! This leads to bitterness and that &#8220;Charbucks&#8221; flavor. Our brew method shoots jets of air into the coffee at predetermined strengths and intervals, ensuring that all grounds are equally extracted, using the perfect amount of force and brew time for each individual bean variety. Plus it&#8217;s fun to watch!</p>
</div>
<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns gallery-padding end">
<h3>•• Step 4 ••</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1267 size-large colorbox-1207" src="http://oakleafcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/comic4.svg" alt="comic4" width="144" height="144" />
<p>You&#8217;ve got coffee! In less than the two minutes since you placed your order, we&#8217;ve gone from whole beans to your lips. It&#8217;s not just marketing when we say we have the freshest coffee in Boston! With such a quick brew cycle, more of the tasty bits of the coffee bean go in your tummy, instead of evaporating off of the grinds, or separating out in the pot. When you combine that with the benefits of a completely even brew cycle uniquely tailored to each bean variety&#8230; let&#8217;s just say you&#8217;re in for a treat!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns gallery-padding">
<h3>The Beans</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1672 colorbox-1207" src="http://oakleafcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/coffee1_c.jpg" alt="coffee1_c" width="100%" />
<p>Our roaster is <em><strong><a href="http://www.barringtoncoffee.com">Barrington Coffee Roasting Co</a>.</strong></em> of Lee, Massachusetts.  They are, much like us, that rare bread of a small, local business, who has become world renowned for their quality and craftsmanship.  They source their beans directly from individual farmers, which is where many of the beans&#8217; names come from.  While different types of beans do rotate seasonally from time to time, these are the strands we are currently brewing:</p>
<dl class="accordion" data-accordion="myAccordionGroup">
<dd class="accordion-navigation"><a href="#panel-1"> <strong>Yirgacheffe</strong> :: Ethiopian :: Light roast</a></p>
<div id="panel-1" class="content">Origin- Yirgacheffe, Ethiopian Highlands<br />
Altitude- 5900-6500′<br />
Varietal- Native heirloom varietals<br />
Process- Washed, sun dried<br />
Roast- LightHoney and flowers, juicy clementine, bergamot.This beautiful, washed Yirgacheffe was prepared at the Alemu Washing Station in the Mendero Mountains just to the south of Sidama. Alemu is one of several coffee preparation stations that is a part of the Kochere Coffee Cooperative, comprised of approximately 500 farmers. We are big fans of coffee from the Kochere Cooperative as the care and pride the members take in the cultivation and preparation of their coffees shows beautifully in the cup, year in and out.Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee. Coffee trees are native to Ethiopia and coffee grows wild throughout the countryside. Ethiopia has an incredibly broad diversity of coffee growing regions, of which Harrar, Sidama, Yirgacheffe and Djimmah are the best known. A great Yirgacheffe such as this Kochere possesses focused citrus flavors that are offset by herbal qualities. These flavors and soft impression of body evoke a coffee with pronounced tea like characteristics.</div>

<div id="panel-2" class="content">Origin- Sidama, Ethiopia<br />
Varietal- Mixed heirlooms<br />
Process- Natural, dried on raised beds<br />
Roast- MediumCandied wild blueberry, deeply earthy, lingering spice.This coffee pulls out all the stops; wonderful and focused when served black as either drip or press, like an incredible dessert when combined with condiments, and intensely saturated when served as an extraction through the espresso machine.“The Natural” refers to the manner in which this coffee is processed. The coffee cherry is dried in the sun on elevated tables. Once dried, the seeds are extracted from the dried fruit and hull. Careful hand sorting throughout the process keeps the cup clean. The beauty of this method is that when properly executed it develops elaborate fruit and berry flavors. In this case, intense, candied blueberry is the result.After drying, the seeds are sealed in Grain-Pro barrier packaging in Ethiopia and then sent on their way to our Roastery where we preserve the green coffee under hermetic seal until it is roasted.</div>

<div id="panel-3" class="content">Origin- Karnataka, India<br />
Altitude- 3800-4400′<br />
Varietal- S-795<br />
Process- Washed, sun dried on patio and raised beds<br />
Roast- MediumSweet, delicate, buttery and creamy with filbert and milk chocolate flavors.This super smooth cup is basked in classic Indian character. It is grown in the Western Ghat mountains by D.M. Purnesh who owns and stewards this land. His complex approach to poly-culture farming includes providing a dense shade canopy of silver oak, jack fruit and fig with companion planting in the understory of vanilla, cardamom, and pepper vines. The orchard is home to a broad diversity of fauna including Jungle Pigeon, owl, deer, fox and wild boar.The farm dates back to 1865 when it was first established by the British. In 1950, the farm changed hands to Purnesh and, in turn, has undergone several changes regarding the coffee varieties planted there. The S-795 variety is now the primary cultivar. S-795 was created in the 1940’s by crossing two older Indian varieties, Kents and S-288.</div>

Roast- DarkOur French Roast is smooth, rich and seductive with a dark chocolate finish. We have purchased this coffee direct from the Vargas family farm through the Coffee Source since 1996. Don Rodrigo Vargas represents the fourth generation from the Vargas family to produce coffee at Doka and he currently oversees all of the Doka production. The farm is located from 4,430-4,790 feet in altitude and is right next to the Poas Volcano in Sabanilla de Alajuela. The Poas Volcano is the largest volcanic crater in the world. This coffee has won our hearts for many years. In addition, it has been recognized at the Sinter Café Cupping Competition as the First Place Winner in 2000.</div>

Varietal- Typica &amp; Bourbon<br />
Process- Washed, sun dried<br />
Roast- DarkRich and smooth with a dark chocolate finish.This coffee is grown in the Sierra Madre Mountains of Southern Mexico in the Chiapas region. It is grown by a cooperative group of farmers who work together as the Unión de Ejidos Profesor Otilio Montaño, or UDEPOM, for short. Ninety-nine percent of the Union members are native Mayan, indigenous from Mache, Tzotzi, Tojolaba, Jaleco and Tzeltal origins. The coffee is grown at between 4,800 and 5,400 feet in altitude and is comprised of family farms between one and ten acres. Each worker in the Union is paid on a work-share basis, rather than by farm yield.An interesting word of note is that this coffee has the smallest carbon footprint of all of our decaffeinated coffees. It is both grown and decaffeinated in the mountains of Mexico. All of our other decaffeinated coffees that hail from farms outside of Mexico must make a stop here at the best decaffeination facility in the the world prior to being shipped to our Roastery in the Berkshires.The Royal Select Water Process removes caffeine from the coffee bean without the use of harmful chemicals or byproducts. We are big proponents of this process because it quite seamlessly removes the caffeine and leaves all of the great coffee flavor.</div>

<h1>Flat Rate Designer Cakes</h1>
<div class="small-12 medium-4 columns gallery-padding">
<p><em>Designer Cakes</em> are our mid-level cake, being something of a cross between our grab-and-go Gourmet cakes, and our highly decorative Custom cakes.  They give you a whole lot of &#8220;Wow!&#8221; without all the &#8220;Owe!&#8221;</p>
<p>Where Custom cakes can be any design you can dream of, Designer cakes are limited in style to save you money.  We have made these cakes to be fun and decorative without breaking the bank.  Therefore, we do not allow customizations to our designer cakes beyond simple color swapping of existing elements.  You simply choose a cake, and that&#8217;s what it looks like: no fuss, no worries!</p>
</div>
<div class="small-12 medium-4 columns gallery-padding">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Designer Cake Pricing:</strong><br />
<strong> $100 = 16 servings (8&#8243; diameter)</strong><br />
<strong> $125 = 20 serving (9&#8243; diameter)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ordering a Designer cake couldn&#8217;t be easier.  Simply <a href="http://oakleafcakes.com/contact"><em><strong>call, click, or stop by</strong></em></a> to place the order.  All we need is the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which cake from the below gallery you&#8217;d like to order.</li>
<li>What flavor you&#8217;d like.</li>
<li>What you&#8217;d like the message to say.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&#8217;s it!</p>
</div>
<div class="small-12 medium-4 columns gallery-padding end">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Designer Cake Flavor Options:</strong><br />
<strong>Moist Yellow Cake</strong><br />
<strong>Red Velvet Cake</strong><br />
<strong>Chocolate Cake</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Designer cakes are built to be as tasty as all of our custom cakes, with each slice being comprised of: 3 layers of cake, 2 layers of our famous vanilla Italian meringue buttercream, an outer buttercream crumb coat and a thin layer of our delicious, home-made marshmallow fondant.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may, with adequate notice, substitute a custom cake flavor for an additional $20.</p>
</div>
<div class="small-12 columns gallery-padding end" style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>All Designer cakes must be ordered at least ONE WEEK prior to your event date.</strong><br />
We highly recommend placing any designer or custom cake order as soon as possible because we do book up, and we cannot guarantee availability without a date deposit.</p>

<strong>$24 = 6 servings (5″ diameter)</strong><br />
<strong>$36 = 12 serving (7″ diameter)<br />
</strong><strong>$60 = 20 serving (9″ diameter)</strong></p>
<p>Ordering a Gourmet cake couldn’t be easier.  Simply <em><strong><a href="http://oakleafcakes.com/contact">call, click, or stop by</a></strong></em> to place the order.  All we need is the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which cake from the below gallery you’d like to order.</li>
<li>What flavor you’d like.</li>
<li>What you’d like the message to say.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;d like to alter any of the cake&#8217;s colors.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it!</p>
</div>
<div class="small-12 medium-4 columns gallery-padding end">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gourmet Cake Flavor Options:</strong><br />
<strong>Moist Yellow Cake</strong><br />
<strong>Red Velvet Cake</strong><br />
<strong>Chocolate Cake</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each cake is comprised of three delicious layers of cake surrounding two layers of our famous, light-and-fluffy Italian meringue buttercream.  Unlike our Designer and Custom cakes, Gourmet cakes have buttercream-only decorations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may, with adequate notice, substitute a custom cake flavor for an additional $15.</p>
</div>
<div class="small-12 columns gallery-padding">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Serve at room temperature.</strong>  If you plan on dropping in to purchase a Gourmet cake from our store, please note that our display case is refrigerated, and that our cake, being made of butter as opposed to oil, chemicals or other preservatives, will need 3+ hours to return to room temperature before eating. A cake, much like any <em>real</em> baked good, will be hard and dry if served cold. So please handle your cake with the care it deserves by serving it at room temperature!</p>
